      <p>-Earth has four layers the crust, mantle, outer core and  inner core.</p>
      <p>
        The crust is about up to 43.5 miles thick, the mantle is about 1801 miles and the outer core is 1367 miles and the last inner core is 950 miles. The crust is actually 2 billion years old. Crust is made out of rocks that are lighter then the rocks that make the mantle

  <h1>Earth`s Creation</h1>
  <h3>The earth, the place we all live, the planet 3rd farthest from the sun and with a population of 7 Billion people. There is a common question of how did this earth become well. So, How did earth become earth? Around 4 Billion years ago our earth wasn't formed but there were salt crystals floating around in space, which clumps together making large meteors that had orbited around the sun 4 years ago These large salt meteors collided together a high speeds but when they collided most of the other salt rock would clump together making it larger but the more meteors that crashed into the forming planet had turned into magma. It has been discovered that 2 massive meteors  collided together causing a large chunk of the molten planet to go flying off and knocking the planet on a 45 degree angle. It was later discovered that the other meteor that hit earth would turn out to orbit the planet becoming our moon. Scientist called Geologists, people who study rocks visit places like craters searching for more evidence on the earth's creation, one very useful resource geologists use are meteorites which are fragments of a meteor that break off and can be found at the crash sites of meteors and can be studied to find the elements of the early earth. 
  </h3>
  <h1>Earth`s Layers</h1>
  <h3>Our Planet may seem very simple but, it gets really complicated the farther you get into the subject, for starters the earth has 4 layers The crust The outer most layer the one we live on its also the thinest layer thats 43.5 miles thick,its also the only layer that has oceans, the layer below it is called the Mantle, the mantle is the thickest layer of the four with a distance of 1801 miles this layer is completly molten, the next layer is the outer core, a layer made of molten metal and has a thickness of 1367 miles and the last layer, The inner core the second thickest layer is made metals and is completly solid due to the gravitatinal pull to the center compressing all the metals down to the middle. </h3>
